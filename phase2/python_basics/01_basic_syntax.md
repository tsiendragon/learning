# Basic Syntax

## Concept Explanation
Python's basic syntax includes variable definitions, data types, control structures, and more.

## Parameter Explanation
- **Variables** : Used to store data.
  - `x = 5`: Define an integer variable.
- **Data Types** : Such as integers, strings, lists.
  - `type(x)`: Get variable type.
- **Control Structures** : Such as conditional statements and loops.
  - `if`: Conditional statements.
  - `for`: Loops.

## Practical Examples
1. Define a variable and print its value:
   ```python
   x = 10
   print(x)
   ```
2. Use `if` statement for condition checking:
   ```python
   if x > 5:
       print("x is greater than 5")
   ```
3. Use `for` loop to iterate through a list:
   ```python
   for i in [1, 2, 3]:
       print(i)
   ```

## Practice Questions
1. How do you define a string variable?
2. Which function is used to get the type of a variable?
3. How do you write a simple `if` statement?
