# Common Development Tools

This section will cover various development tools commonly used in Linux, such as compilers, debuggers, and IDEs.

## Concept Explanation
Development tools are programs used to write, debug, and maintain software, such as compilers, debuggers, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

## Parameter Explanation
- **`gcc`**: GNU Compiler Collection, used to compile C and C++ programs.
  - `-o`: Specifies the output file name.
- **`gdb`**: GNU Debugger, used to debug programs.
  - `break`: Sets a breakpoint.
  - `run`: Runs the program.
- **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment, such as VSCode and PyCharm.

## Practical Examples
1. Use `gcc -o hello hello.c` to compile a C program.
2. Use `gdb hello` to debug a program, set a breakpoint, and run it.
3. Open a project in VSCode, use the built-in terminal to compile and run the program.

## Test Questions
1. How do you use `gcc` to compile a file named `main.c`?
2. Which command is used to start the `gdb` debugger?
3. What is an IDE, and what is its purpose?
