# 4Sum: A Deep Dive into Array Manipulation 🎯

## Problem Overview 🤔

The 4Sum problem is a classic array manipulation challenge that builds upon the concepts of Two Sum and Three Sum. Let's break down what we're trying to solve!

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and a `target` value, we need to find all unique quadruplets that sum up to the target. It's like finding four puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together! 🧩

### Problem Constraints
```
1 <= nums.length <= 200
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
```

## The Journey to an Optimal Solution 🚀

Let's explore different approaches to solve this problem, starting from a basic solution and gradually optimizing it. Each solution brings something unique to the table!

### Solution 1: Recursive Approach with Early Pruning 🌳

Our first solution takes a recursive approach, breaking down the 4Sum problem into smaller subproblems. Think of it like a tree where each level represents one number in our quadruplet.

**Key Insights:**
- 🔍 Sort the array first to handle duplicates and enable pruning
- 🚫 Early pruning using sum checks
- 🔄 Recursive reduction from 4Sum to 3Sum to 2Sum

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def fourSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        results = []
        if len(nums)<4:
            return results
        if sum(nums[:4])> target:
            return results
        if sum(nums[-4:])< target:
            return results
        for i, num in enumerate(nums[:-3]):
            current_result = self.three_sum(nums[i+1:], target-nums[i])
            current_result = [xi + [num] for xi in current_result]
            results += current_result
        results = [tuple(x) for x in results]
        results = list(set(results))
        results = [list(xi) for xi in results]
        return results

    def three_sum(self, nums, target):
        results = []
        if sum(nums[:3])> target:
            return results
        if sum(nums[-3:])< target:
            return results
        for i, num in enumerate(nums[:-2]):
            current_results = self.two_sum(nums[i+1:], target-nums[i])
            current_results = [xi + [num] for xi in current_results]
            results += current_results
        return results



    def two_sum(self, nums, target):
        # assume nums is sorted
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0
        j = n-1
        current_sum = nums[i]+nums[j]
        results = []
        if sum(nums[:2]) > target:
            return results
        if sum(nums[-2:]) < target:
            return results
        while i<j:
            current_sum = nums[i]+nums[j]

            if current_sum==target:
                results.append([nums[i], nums[j]])
                i +=1
            elif current_sum < target:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return results




if __name__ == '__main__':
    nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2]
    target = 0
    s = Solution()
    y = s.fourSum(nums=nums,target=target)
    print(y)
```

This solution works by:
1. 📊 Sorting the array first
2. ✂️ Pruning impossible cases early (if smallest 4 sum > target or largest 4 sum < target)
3. 🔁 Using recursion to break down the problem
4. 🎯 Handling duplicates with set conversion

### Solution 2: Optimizing Two Sum with Early Return 🏃‍♂️

In our second solution, we made a key optimization in the two_sum function. By adding an early return when we find a match, we can speed up the process significantly!

**What Changed:**
- ⚡ Added `j -= 1` for faster traversal
- 🎯 Early return on match
- 🔄 Maintained the same overall structure

```python
    def two_sum(self, nums, target):
        # assume nums is sorted
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0
        j = n-1
        current_sum = nums[i]+nums[j]
        results = []
        if sum(nums[:2]) > target:
            return results
        if sum(nums[-2:]) < target:
            return results
        while i<j:
            current_sum = nums[i]+nums[j]

            if current_sum==target:
                results.append([nums[i], nums[j]])
                i +=1
                j -=1 # Since we dont need to care the duplicatesd
            elif current_sum < target:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return results
```

The results speak for themselves:

### Solution 3: Smart Duplicate Handling 🧠

Our third solution introduces smart duplicate handling, which significantly improves performance by skipping redundant calculations.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🏃‍♂️ Skip duplicate values
- 🎯 More efficient pointer movement
- 💡 Smarter comparison logic

```python
    def two_sum(self, nums, target):
        # assume nums is sorted
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0
        j = n-1
        results = []
        if sum(nums[:2]) > target:
            return results
        if sum(nums[-2:]) < target:
            return results
        while i<j:
            current_sum = nums[i]+nums[j]
            if current_sum==target:
                results.append([nums[i], nums[j]])
                i +=1
                while i < j and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                    i += 1
                j -=1
                while i<j and nums[j]==nums[j+1]:
                    j -= 1
            elif current_sum < target:
                i += 1

            else:
                j -= 1
```

            if N == 2: # two pointers solve sorted 2-sum problem
                results += [result+x for x in self.two_sum(l,r,nums, target)]
            else: # recursively reduce N
                for i in range(l, r+1):
                    if i == l or (i > l and nums[i-1] != nums[i]):

            if s == target:
                results.append([nums[l], nums[r]])
                l += 1
                while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l-1]:
                    l += 1
                r -=1
                while l<r and nums[r] ==nums[r+1]:
                    r -= 1
            elif s < target:
                l += 1
            else:
